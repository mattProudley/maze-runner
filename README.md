# maze-runner
If it works properly (witch will be crazy because I haven't got a robot to test it on) then it should allow the robot to move and change direction based on what sensor is covered. The pin values are all set to 0 and will need to be changed before uploading. It should compile fine as I have uploaded it to my Arduino as a test. There is a another zip file included aswell (sharpIR) that will have to be added as a plugin inside the arduino ide.
